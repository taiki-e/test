A cargo subcommand to provide some options useful for testing and continuous
integration.

## Installation

```sh
cargo install cargo-hack
```

Alternatively, download compiled binaries from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/releases).

*Compiler support: requires rustc 1.36+*

cargo-hack is usually runnable with Cargo versions older than the Rust version
required for installation (e.g., `cargo +1.31 hack check`). Currently, to run
cargo-hack requires Cargo 1.26+.

## Usage

*See `cargo hack --help` for a complete list of options ([output is here](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/blob/HEAD/tests/long-help.txt)).*

`cargo-hack` is basically wrapper of `cargo` that propagates subcommand and most
of the passed flags to `cargo`, but provides additional flags and changes the
behavior of some existing flags.

### --each-feature

Perform for each feature which includes default features and
`--no-default-features` of the package.

This is useful to check that each feature is working properly. (When used for
this purpose, it is recommended to use with `--no-dev-deps` to avoid
[cargo#4866].)

```sh
cargo hack check --each-feature --no-dev-deps
```

### --feature-powerset

Perform for the feature powerset which includes `--no-default-features` and
default features of the package.

This is useful to check that every combination of features is working
properly. (When used for this purpose, it is recommended to use with
`--no-dev-deps` to avoid [cargo#4866].)

```sh
cargo hack check --feature-powerset --no-dev-deps
```

### --no-dev-deps

Perform without dev-dependencies.

This is a workaround for an issue that dev-dependencies leaking into normal
build ([cargo#4866]).

Also, this can be used as a workaround for an issue that `cargo` does not
allow publishing a package with cyclic dev-dependencies. ([cargo#4242])

```sh
cargo hack publish --no-dev-deps --dry-run --allow-dirty
```

Note: Currently, using `--no-dev-deps` flag removes dev-dependencies from
real manifest while cargo-hack is running and restores it when finished.
See [cargo#4242] for why this is necessary.
Also, this behavior may change in the future on some subcommands. See also
[#15].

### --remove-dev-deps

Equivalent to `--no-dev-deps` except for does not restore the original
`Cargo.toml` after execution.

This is useful to know what Cargo.toml that cargo-hack is actually using
with `--no-dev-deps`.

*This flag also works without subcommands.*

### --ignore-private

Skip to perform on `publish = false` packages.

### --ignore-unknown-features

Skip passing `--features` to `cargo` if that feature does not exist.

### --version-range

Perform commands on a specified (inclusive) range of Rust versions.

```console
$ cargo hack check --version-range 1.46..1.47
info: running `cargo +1.46 check` on cargo-hack (1/2)
...
info: running `cargo +1.47 check` on cargo-hack (2/2)
...
```

If the given range is unclosed, the latest stable compiler is treated as the
upper bound.

This might be useful for catching issues like [termcolor#35], [regex#685],
[rust-clippy#6324].

### --version-step

Specify the version interval of `--version-range`.

### --clean-per-run

Remove artifacts for that package before running the command.

This also works as a workaround for [rust-clippy#4612].

### Options for adjusting the behavior of --each-feature and --feature-powerset

The following flags can be used with `--each-feature` and `--feature-powerset`.

#### --optional-deps

Use optional dependencies as features.

#### --exclude-features, --skip

Space-separated list of features to exclude.

#### --depth

Specify a max number of simultaneous feature flags of `--feature-powerset`.

If the number is set to 1, `--feature-powerset` is equivalent to
`--each-feature`.

#### --group-features

Space-separated list of features to group.

To specify multiple groups, use this option multiple times:
`--group-features a,b --group-features c,d`

### Improvement of the behavior of existing cargo flags

`cargo-hack` changes the behavior of the following existing flags.

#### --features, --no-default-features

Unlike `cargo` ([cargo#3620], [cargo#4106], [cargo#4463], [cargo#4753],
[cargo#5015], [cargo#5364], [cargo#6195]), it can also be applied to
sub-crates.

#### --all, --workspace

Perform command for all packages in the workspace.

Unlike cargo, it does not compile all members at once.

For example, running `cargo hack check --all` in a workspace with members
`foo` and `bar` behaves almost the same as the following script:

```sh
# If you use cargo-hack, you don't need to maintain this list manually.
members=("foo" "bar")

for member in "${members[@]}"; do
    cargo check --manifest-path "${member}/Cargo.toml"
done
```

*Workspace members will be performed according to the order of the 'packages'
fields of [`cargo metadata`][cargo-metadata].*
